Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs the updated Process Document with the added context around evidence requirements for resolution or decommissioning. I‚Äôve added a new section called ‚ÄúEvidence Requirements‚Äù and revised Step 4 to include this verification.

Process Document: Splunk Logging Compliance Review

Owner: [Team Name Taking Ownership]
Prepared by: [Your Name / Team]
Last Updated: [Date]

‚∏ª

Purpose

This process guides how to identify, assess, and remediate non-compliant assets (machines/servers) that are not logging to Splunk. The objective is to maintain visibility and accountability for all critical systems and ensure full compliance with logging and monitoring requirements.

‚∏ª

Scope
	‚Ä¢	Rolling weekly analysis of system log activity
	‚Ä¢	Monthly update to the official asset inventory
	‚Ä¢	Investigation, documentation, and resolution of non-logging systems
	‚Ä¢	Use of dashboards and app tools to triage and track progress

‚∏ª

Key Concepts
	‚Ä¢	Non-compliant Asset: A system that failed to log within a defined rolling time window.
	‚Ä¢	Threshold: Percent of missed logging intervals (e.g., 90% = only 1 week of logs in 10 weeks).
	‚Ä¢	Critical System: A machine essential to business continuity or security.
	‚Ä¢	Operational Status: Indicates whether the system is active, offline, or decommissioned.

‚∏ª

Data Update Frequency

Data Element	Update Frequency
Log Activity Check	Weekly (Rolling Window)
Asset Inventory List	Monthly


‚∏ª

Tools

1. Splunk Reporting Dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Asset list with:
	‚Ä¢	Hostname, Machine ID
	‚Ä¢	Reporting thresholds
	‚Ä¢	Operational status
	‚Ä¢	Report month
	‚Ä¢	Use for prioritization and triage

2. Splunk Interactive Compliance App
	‚Ä¢	Asset records with:
	‚Ä¢	Hostname, threshold
	‚Ä¢	Status selector
	‚Ä¢	Comment field
	‚Ä¢	Exception tracking
	‚Ä¢	Alert suppression

‚∏ª

Evidence Requirements

All resolution statuses must be backed by evidence, depending on the outcome:

Outcome	Required Evidence
‚úÖ Resolved (logging restored)	A valid RITM, Change, or Incident ticket showing the fix was implemented (e.g., reinstall agent, open port, etc.)
üõë Decommissioned / Non-Operational	Valid evidence that the asset is no longer in use (e.g., CMDB entry, retirement ticket, or confirmation from Infra/Platform owner). The asset should be flagged for removal from the critical asset list.
üìù Exception Filed	Exception ticket ID or link must be recorded in the Exception field of the app.
üö´ Suppressed	Must include a justification and supporting context in the comments field.


‚∏ª

Weekly Workflow

Step 1: Open Dashboards
	‚Ä¢	Access the Splunk Reporting Dashboard and Compliance App
	‚Ä¢	Confirm data is current for the week and month

‚∏ª

Step 2: Triage and Prioritize

Sort systems by:
	1.	Operational Status = Active
	2.	Criticality (if known)
	3.	High threshold of missed logs
	4.	Sudden change in logging pattern

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt prioritize only by threshold‚Äîcritical assets that recently stopped logging take precedence.

‚∏ª

Step 3: Investigate

For each non-compliant system:
	‚Ä¢	Validate if the system is:
	‚Ä¢	Logging but misclassified
	‚Ä¢	Inactive or decommissioned
	‚Ä¢	Still active but misconfigured
	‚Ä¢	Use secondary systems (CMDB, inventory, platform tools) to validate operational status
	‚Ä¢	Collaborate with system owners or platform teams if needed

‚∏ª

Step 4: Document in App + Attach Evidence

In the Interactive Compliance App:
	‚Ä¢	Add a comment summarizing the investigation
	‚Ä¢	Update the Status using one of the following:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Resolved ‚Äì Must include ticket number
	‚Ä¢	üõë Non-Operational / Decommissioned ‚Äì Must include evidence source
	‚Ä¢	üü° Work in Progress
	‚Ä¢	üìù Exception Filed ‚Äì Include exception ticket/link
	‚Ä¢	Toggle Suppress Alert only with justification
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all supporting ticket numbers or validation are entered in the Comment or Exception fields

‚∏ª

Step 5: Escalate Critical Issues

Immediately escalate if:
	‚Ä¢	A critical asset has recently stopped logging
	‚Ä¢	No explanation can be found after investigation

Include:
	‚Ä¢	Hostname, ID, logging gap timeframe
	‚Ä¢	Any evidence or known issues
	‚Ä¢	Escalate to: [Escalation DL or Contact]

‚∏ª

Optional Weekly Summary
	‚Ä¢	of systems reviewed
	‚Ä¢	resolved (with evidence)
	‚Ä¢	non-operational (pending removal)
	‚Ä¢	escalations or exceptions

‚∏ª

Analyst Tips
	‚Ä¢	Always validate before marking anything as resolved or decommissioned.
	‚Ä¢	No undocumented assumptions‚Äîlog evidence or source of truth.
	‚Ä¢	Review clusters or tags for pattern detection (e.g., platform outages).
	‚Ä¢	If unsure, escalate early instead of suppressing without review.
